# TeXDas
I have added one package (TeXDas.sty) and one class (AssignmentsTeXDas.cls) which can be used to prepare quizzes, assignments etc. User can build on their own on top of it so as to use these for various purposes.

Currently it can be used for two different purposes:
(a) Preparing assignments
(b) Declaration
